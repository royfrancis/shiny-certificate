This is an R shiny app to create certificates for NBIS workshops.

This app requires the following R packages:

```
install.packages(c(Cairo, ggplot2, ggtext, png, shiny, shinythemes, shinyAce, showtext))
```

This is not an R package. Change to app directory and run app using `runApp("app.R")`. Click [here](https://roymf.shinyapps.io/certificate/) to see a demo of this app. This link may not always be active.
